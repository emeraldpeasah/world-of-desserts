      <h2>Gooey Fudgy Brownies</h2>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>225g of quality chocolate</li>
        <li>170g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>250g sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>95g plain flour</li>
        <li>30g cocoa powder</li>
      </ul>

<h3> Method </h3>

<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Chop the chocolate into chunks. Melt half of the chocolate in the microwave in 20-second intervals, saving the other half for later.</li>
<br>
  <li>In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer, then beat in the eggs and vanilla until the mixture becomes fluffy and light in colour.</li>
  <br>
    <li>Whisk in the melted chocolate (make sure it's not too hot or else the eggs will cook), then sift in the flour and cocoa powder. Fold to incorporate the dry ingredient.</li>
<br>
<li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then transfer the batter to the prepared baking dish.</li>
<br>
<li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, depending on how fudgy you like your brownies, then cool completely.</li>
<br>
<li>Enjoy!</li>

  <p>Within a paragraph you can make text <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic</em>. In fact it's probably bad to think of these as bold and italic - instead you should genuinely consider them as 'strong' and 'emphasised' - you can decide exactly how to display them in you css, bold and italic are just the defaults. This is an example of <em>symantic markup</em>: you're adding information as to the interpretation of certain words, rather than dictating how they should be displayed.</p>

  <h2>Blank lines and void tags</h2>

  <p>It is also possible to insert extra blank lines manually using the br tag. The br tag is a special type of tag (called a 'void tag'); you don't need a closing br tag, just un opening one.</p>

  <h2>Comments</h2>

  <p>You can write comments in your html code, which won't be displayed in the browser.</p>

  <!--- This is a comment. It won't show up in the page, but you will be able to see it if you view the page source (be warned!) -->



  <p>You don't often see lists in their basic form, but lists are heavily used in websites; dropdown menus are often cleverly styled lists.</p>

  <h2>Links</h2>
  <p>Links look like this: <a href="http://www.facebook.com">link to facebook</a>. You specify where you want the link to point by specifying the 'href' inside the &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>

  <p>The href can also point to local files. For example, <a href="./example.html">this</a> is a link to this page you're reading at the moment. Notice that the protocol and host part of the URL has been replaced by a "."</p>

  <h2>Images</h2>
  <p>Images are a bit like links. You specify the location of the image with the 'src' property in the &lt;img&gt; tag. Note that img tags are like br tags: they don't come in pairs. The 'alt' property should be used to provide a description of the image in case it won't load or the user is partially sighted.</p>

  <p>Images can be stored on the same host ... </p>

  <h2>Tables</h2>
  <p>Tables are used for holding data</p>
  <table class='table'>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>College</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tom</td>
      <td>Oriel</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dave</td>
      <td>Hertford</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
