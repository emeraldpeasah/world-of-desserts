	<h2>Glazed Doughnuts with Sprinkles</h2>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>265g (8 1/2oz) strong white bread flour</li>
	<li>40g caster sugar</li>
	<li>1 x 7g (1/4oz) sachet fast-action yeast</li>
	<li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
	<li>75ml (3fl oz) milk</li>
	<li>65g (2 1/2oz) unsalted butter, melted</li>
	<li>1.5 ltr (2 1/2 pints) sunflower oil</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3> Method </h3>

<ol>
	<li>Put the flour, sugar, yeast and 3/4 tsp salt in the bowl of a food mixer. Beat on a low speed until combined, then gradually add the egg, followed by the milk and butter. Increase the speed to medium and beat for 10 minutes to make a glossy, elastic ball of dough. Remove, place in an oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
	<li>Knock back the dough, and then knead for 3-5 minutes. Divide the dough into 10 equal-sized pieces (use scales to be exact). Roll into balls, put on a floured baking tray (allowing plenty of room between each), cover with cling film and leave in a warm place until almost doubled in size.</li>
	<li>Pour the sunflower oil into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan or deep-fat fryer. There should be at least 5cm (2 1/2in) between the oil and the top of the pan. Heat the oil to 180Â°C, being careful never to leave the oil unattended. Using a slotted spoon, lower 3 dough balls into the oil and and fry for about 3 minutes, until puffed and golden. You will need to turn them over and hold them down after a minute or two as they begin to float. Carefully remove from the pan and leave to drain on kitchen paper. Repeat with the remaining dough. </li>
	<li>Enjoy!</li>
